## Welcome to the [MiniAiLive](https://www.miniai.live/)!
Welcome to the ID Document Recognition SDK! This SDK provides powerful tools for recognizing and extracting information from ID documents. The SDK is available for both Windows and Linux platforms and includes an API for integration.

Introducing our ID Document Recognition Windows SDK. Reduce drop-off and boost conversions with ID scanning and verification solutions. 
Quickly and securely capture, extract, and verify data from diverse ID cards, passports, driverâ€™s licenses, and other documents with our proven, AI-first approach.
Designed to fit seamlessly together, our technology can be integrated as a fully-bundled identity document verification solution or as separate modules via developer-friendly mobile or server SDK.
Try it out today!

> **Note**
>
> - Our SDK is fully on-premise, processing all happens on hosting server and no data leaves server.
>
> - 10,000+ document templates covering IDs issued in 200+ countries and territories.
>
> - Support of 100+ languages and special characters via sophisticated neural networks.

## API Details

### Endpoint

- `POST http://127.0.0.1:8082/id_check` ID Document Recognition API

- `POST http://127.0.0.1:8082/bank_credit_check` Bank & Credit Card Reader API

- `POST http://127.0.0.1:8082/mrz_barcode_check` MRZ & Barcode Recognition API

### Request

- **URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8082/id_check`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Form Data:**
  - `image`: The image file (PNG, JPG, etc.) to be analyzed. This should be provided as a file upload.

### Response

The API returns a JSON object with the recognized details from the ID document. Here is an example response:

## Gradio Demo

We have included a Gradio demo to showcase the capabilities of our ID Document Recognition SDK. Gradio is a Python library that allows you to quickly create user interfaces for machine learning models.

### How to Run the Gradio Demo

1. **Install Gradio:**

   First, you need to install Gradio. You can do this using pip:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MiniAiLive/ID-DocumentRecognition-Windows.git
   cd gradio
   pip install -r requirement.txt
   ```
2. **Run Gradio Demo:**
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
## Python Test API Example

To help you get started with using the API, here is a comprehensive example of how to interact with the ID Document Recognition API using Python. You can use API with other language you want to use like C++, C#, Ruby, Java, Javascript and more

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- `requests` library (you can install it using `pip install requests`)

### Example Script

This example demonstrates how to send an image file to the API endpoint and process the response.

```python
import requests

# URL of the web API endpoint
url = 'http://127.0.0.1:8082/id_check'

# Path to the image file you want to send
image_path = './test_image.jpg'

# Read the image file and send it as form data
files = {'image': open(image_path, 'rb')}

try:
    # Send POST request
    response = requests.post(url, files=files)

    # Check if the request was successful
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print('Request was successful!')
        # Parse the JSON response
        response_data = response.json()
        print('Response Data:', response_data)
    else:
        print('Request failed with status code:', response.status_code)
        print('Response content:', response.text)

except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print('An error occurred:', e)
```
